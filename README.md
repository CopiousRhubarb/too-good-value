Calculates the amount saved when opting for a "too good to go" surprise bag from Black Market Bakery

### Background
Too Good to Go is a social impact company on a missing to empower everyone to fight food waste. 
Local businesses gather food which is about to go bad, and community members buy the food at a discount in a surprise bag. 
According to the WWF (2001), 40% of the food that we produce globally goes to waste. 
By selling the food that would have otherwise been thrown away, we help reduce food waste. 

### Personal Connection
Locally, my favorite surprise bag is from Blackmarket Bakery, I buy their surprise bag as frequently as I can. 
On the app the bag of baked goods costs $5.99 and it says the value of the bag is $18. 
I want to know if I am getting more than an $18 value, so we created this program to enter the baked goods we get and calculate the actual value of the surprise bag.
